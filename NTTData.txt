An index is a schema object that contains an entry for each value that appears in the indexed column(s) of the table or 
cluster and provides direct, fast access to rows. 
Oracle Database supports several types of index: Normal indexes. (By default, Oracle Database creates B-tree indexes.)

Hash Joins

The nested loops join, also called nested iteration, uses one join input as the outer input table 
(shown as the top input in the graphical execution plan) and one as the inner (bottom) input table. 
The outer loop consumes the outer input table row by row.

HASH joins are the usual choice of the Oracle optimizer when the memory is set up to accommodate them. 
In a HASH join, Oracle accesses one table
 (usually the smaller of the joined results) and builds a hash table on the join key in memory.
