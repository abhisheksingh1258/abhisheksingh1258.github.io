<body>
<p>We can manipulate the information within a SQL statement by means of assigning a name to a "select statement", 
this concept is known a cursor. 
A cursor is used for processing individual rows returned as a result for a query.<br>
Oracle creates a memory area, known as the context area, for processing an SQL statement, which contains all the information needed for processing the statement; for example, the number of rows processed, etc.

A cursor is a pointer to this context area. PL/SQL controls the context area through a cursor. A cursor holds the rows (one or more) returned by a SQL statement. 
The set of rows the cursor holds is referred to as the active set.

<p> Declare a Type and create a cursor variable for that type<br>
