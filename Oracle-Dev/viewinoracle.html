<h1>Views in Oracle</h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>View is simply the subset of table which are stored logicaly in a database which means it is a virtual table in the database
   whose contents are defined by a query.<br>To the database user,the view appears just like a real table, with a set of named columns
and rows of data.</p>

<h2>Advantages of view</h2>

<p>Security-> Each user can be given permission to access the database only through a small set of views that contain the specific data the user
is authorized to see, thus restricting the user's access to stored data<br><br>
Query Simplicity-> A view can draw data from several different tables and present it as a single table, turning multi-table queries into single table queries
against the view<br><br>
Structural simplicity->Views can give a user a "personalized" view of the database structure, presenting the database as a set of virtual tables that 
make sense for that user.<br><br>
Consistency->A view can present a consistent, unchanged image of the structure of the database, even if the underlying source tables are split, 
restructured, or renamed.<br>
Data Integrity->If data is accessed and entered through a view, the DBMS can automatically check the data to ensure that it meets 
the specified integrity constraints.<br><br>
<h3>Disadvantage of Views</h3>

Performance->Views create the appearance of a table, but the DBMS must still translate queries against the view into queries against the underlying source tables. 
If the view is defined by a complex, multi-table query then simple queries on the views may take considerable time.<br><br>

Update restrictions->When a user tries to update rows of a view, the DBMS must translate the request into an update on rows of the underlying source tables. 
This is possible for simple views, but more complex views are often restricted to read-only.


<h3>to create an updatable view, the SELECT statement that defines the view must not contain any of the following elements:</h3>

Aggregate functions such as MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.<br>
DISTINCT<br>
GROUP BY clause.<br>
HAVING clause.<br>
UNION or UNION ALL clause.<br>
Left join or outer join.<br>
Subquery in the SELECT clause or in the WHERE clause that refers to the table appeared in the FROM clause.<br>
Reference to non-updatable view in the FROM clause.<br>
Reference only to literal values.<br>
Multiple references to any column of the base table.<br>

<h3>The following query gets all views from the classicmodels database and shows which views are updatable.</h3>

SELECT 
    table_name, is_updatable
FROM
    information_schema.views
WHERE
    table_schema = 'classicmodels'; <br>
	
	
Yes, when you update a view it affects original table, because SELECT opens an implicit cursor which points to the records from the base table.
 When ever you update the records it updates the original data since they are pointers to the original.	<br>
 
 
 <h3>Materialized Views</h3>
 
 
 A materialized view in Oracle is a database object that contains the results of a query. They are local copies of data located remotely, or are used to create summary tables based on aggregations of a table's data. Materialized views, which store data based on remote tables are also, know as snapshots.

A materialized view can query tables, views, and other materialized views. Collectively these are called master tables (a replication term) or detail tables (a data warehouse term).

For replication purposes, materialized views allow you to maintain copies of remote data on your local node. These copies are read-only. If you want to update the local copies, you have to use the Advanced Replication feature. You can select data from a materialized view as you would from a table or view.

For data warehousing purposes, the materialized views commonly created are aggregate views, single-table aggregate views, and join views.

<h3>View example</h3>
 CREATE VIEW LuxuryItems AS<br>
    SELECT <br>
        *<br>
    FROM<br>
        items<br>
    WHERE<br>
        price > 700;
