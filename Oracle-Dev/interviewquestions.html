<b>Zombie and Orphan Processes</b>

Normally, when a child process is killed, the parent process is updated via a SIGCHLD signal.<br> 
Then the parent can do some other task or restart a new child as needed. <br>
However, sometimes the parent process is killed before its child is killed. In this case, the "parent of all processes,"<br> 
the init process, becomes the new PPID (parent process ID). In some cases, these processes are called orphan processes.<br>

When a process is killed, a ps listing may still show the process with a Z state. This is a zombie or defunct process.<br> 
The process is dead and not being used. These processes are different from the orphan processes. <br>
They have completed execution but still find an entry in the process table.<br>


<b>Job ID Versus Process ID</b>
Background and suspended processes are usually manipulated via job number (job ID).<br>
 This number is different from the process ID and is used because it is shorter.<br>

In addition, a job can consist of multiple processes running in a series or at the same time, in parallel. 
Using the job ID is easier than tracking individual processes.<br>
