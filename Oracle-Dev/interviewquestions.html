How find files having size 5gb?<br>
find /etc -size +100k<br>
If we look at their sizes, they really are above 100k<br>

<b>Zombie and Orphan Processes</b>

Normally, when a child process is killed, the parent process is updated via a SIGCHLD signal.<br> 
Then the parent can do some other task or restart a new child as needed. <br>
However, sometimes the parent process is killed before its child is killed. In this case, the "parent of all processes,"<br> 
the init process, becomes the new PPID (parent process ID). In some cases, these processes are called orphan processes.<br>

When a process is killed, a ps listing may still show the process with a Z state. This is a zombie or defunct process.<br> 
The process is dead and not being used. These processes are different from the orphan processes. <br>
They have completed execution but still find an entry in the process table.<br>


<b>Job ID Versus Process ID</b>
Background and suspended processes are usually manipulated via job number (job ID).<br>
 This number is different from the process ID and is used because it is shorter.<br>

In addition, a job can consist of multiple processes running in a series or at the same time, in parallel. 
Using the job ID is easier than tracking individual processes.<br>

Join A1 and A2 -> Inner Join->9 rows, left and right outer join->9 rows<br><br>


finding the missing numbers from a sequence of numbers:<br>

select min_a - 1 + level<br>
     from ( select min(a1) min_a<br>
                 , max(a1) max_a<br>
              from t1<br>
          )
  connect by level <= max_a - min_a + 1<br>
    minus<br>
   select a1

<h2>SQL Loader questions?</h2>

<ul>
<li> we cannot put dml statements in control file</li>
<li>Bad file: The bad file contains rows that were rejected because of errors. <br>
These errors might include bad datatypes or referential integrity constraints</li>
<li>Discard file: The discard file contains rows that were discarded because they were filtered out because<br> of a statement in the SQL*Loader control file.</li>
<li>Which triggering events can cause a trigger to fire?</li>
A specific error or any error occurs



</ul>

create table phone_number_selection_history(phone_number number(10) ,last_lock_time date,
constraint ph_num1_pk primary key(phone_number));
